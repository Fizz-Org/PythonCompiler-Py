We are making two compilers for Python: one in Python and one in Rust. We try to keep them as close to vanilla python and as close to each other, with a few axtra features. These include built-in GUI support and popular libraries like random without requiring import. This will technically be its own programming language, and due to compatibality issues, our file extention will be `.fpy` (Fizz Python). Vanilla Python will work with our compiler, but Fizz Python might not sometimes.
> Please note: this is a compiler, not an interpreter, so that already completley changes how you use Python.

## Features
- Built-in GUI funtions.
- Built-in common libraries, like random, time, etc.
